How To Make Buttermilk Waffles
Since sharing our waffle recipe, many of our readers have asked if our waffles recipe can be made using buttermilk. The answer is 100% yes! Since we rarely have buttermilk in the fridge when waffle cravings hit, we thought it was important to share how to make them without buttermilk, but the great thing about this recipe is that you can use regular milk, non-dairy milk, and even buttermilk.

Step By Step Method For Making Waffles
The process for making these waffles could not be simpler. Let me walk you through how I do it:

Whisk the dry ingredients together. That’s the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and a touch of salt.
Whisk the wet ingredients together in another bowl or do what I do and whisk them right in a measuring jug. Hooray for less dishes!
Combine the wet and dry ingredients. I whisk until I no longer see streaks of flour. If there are a few small lumps of flour left, that’s okay.
Set the batter aside for 10 minutes. In this time, you can preheat your oven (I talk about why below) as well as your waffle iron. The 10 minutes of rest time allows the baking powder to activate.
Cook the waffles. I use about 1/2 cup of batter for each waffle, but the amount of batter will depend on your waffle iron.
